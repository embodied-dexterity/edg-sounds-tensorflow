# EDG Sound Classification Process

The following describes everything that you'll need to know to start classifying sound data using Tensorflow with no prior coding experience necessary. Please email kafkaloff@berkeley.edu if you have any questions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you download all necessary software and files to start running the python template on your local machine for development.

### Installations

Necessary files and software that you need to install/download and how to install/download them.

#### Command Line Installations

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```
pip install tensorflow
pip install librosa
```

#### Downloads

* [Download Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Download sound_classification_template.py
* [Download sample sound sets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14DmBB15mLApoZCy9pjt0y1hjFr-XVZ-H?usp=sharing)

### Running Python Files

To run a python file (*.py), enter the following in your terminal from the same directory as the python file:

```
python3 <file name>.py
```
